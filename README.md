## Motivation
Waking up, I would frequently get distracted, checking other apps after I'd looked at the weather on my phone. Since this app uses SMS, I can still stay informed about the day and prevent distraction from happening by keeping my phone offline until I'm ready to start the day.

## Example
![Example Output](https://github.com/followingell/curtains/images/example.png)

## Features
- **Weather Reporting:** *actual temperature, weather condition, humidity, precipitation, wind & sunset time.*
- **News:** *today's top headline with link to story & historic headline with link to story.*

Weather and news are customisable. App design allows for new components to be added easily.
